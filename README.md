# Map-Navigator
## Course Description

This course was all about improving our programming skills through hands-on coding exercises. We learned how to debug, optimize, and manage our code efficiently.

## Practical Work

For the final project, we developed an interactive map system in C++. The program loaded map data from an XML file and allowed users to navigate through different locations, searching for points of interest. The project involved parsing XML files, implementing efficient search algorithms, and designing a user-friendly interface.
